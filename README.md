Bootstrap 4 Starter Template


To use this starter template work on scss, follow this step:

If you're on Windows, you can run the Ruby Installer. On Linux, Rails Ready provides several Ruby essentials. On OS X, Ruby is already installed by default so Ruby just works.

Install Sass
Open up your Terminal.app and type:

Windows:
gem install compass

Linux / OS X:
sudo gem install compass

CSS Parser:
gem install css_parser


On your project directory run this command and let Compass do its thing:
compass watch
or
compass compile
